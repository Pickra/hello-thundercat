            >Snarf</a>. When the Mutants boarded their ship, Cheetara joined the
            other ThunderCats and bravely fought them off. She was given a new
            outfit and her Staff to help defend herself on their new home by
            Jaga, along with her fellow ThunderCats. Cheetara helped defend the
            ship from the attacking Mutants, going into suspension to make the
            journey to the new planet chosen as the ThunderCats' new home.
            She was then revived with the others when they reached their new
            home on Third Earth, and after defeating the Mutants,
            prepared with the others to build a new home.

        <p>Cheetara's amazing speed has often saved the other ThunderCats from
            deadly situations. Once when&#32;
            <a target="_blank" href="http://thundercats.wikia.com/wiki/Tygra" title="Tygra">Tygra</a>&#32;
            ventured into a mysterious cave, he found himself beginning to age
            rapidly, Cheetara was the only one who could get in and out of the
            cave fast enough to save Tygra from death.
        </p>
        <p>When the time of Lion-O's Anointment Trials came, it was Cheetara's
            task, as the fastest of the ThunderCats, to try Lion-O in speed.
            Lion-O knew he could not beat Cheetara in a race, and so took a
            dangerous western route as an alternative. Already miles ahead of
            Lion-O, Cheetara ran into the Mutants, who pursued her on land and
            underwater. Luckily Panthro arrived in the Thundertank to assist the
            outnumbered Cheetara. Cheetara was ahead by a mile and two thirds,
            eventually coming face to face with Lion-O, they raced alongside one
            another to the finish of their race. Lion-O knew he could not win
            the race in this way, but his sheer determination allowed him to.
            Lion-O at first believed Cheetara had let him win, something which
            offended her, as the code of Thundera forbade such action. The
            distance they ran actually exhausted Cheetara's super speed, and she
            told him that his determination not to lose had allowed him to win the race.
