            to help them adapt in their new home. The Thunderkittens left with

            After the ship crashed on Third Earth, the Thunderkittens helped to

            Wilykit and Kat helped a Wollo who was being robbed, pursuing the
            robbers after they stole a gold bracelet from the Wollo.
            They arrived at the mysterious Tower of Traps, after which Wilykat
            was captured. Wilykit journeyed with Lion-O to the top of the tower,
            avoiding many traps on the way, before rescuing Wilykat and fighting
            some monstrous&#32;

            When the third day of Lion-O's Annointment Trials occurred, it was
            time for the Trial of Cunning. As the most cunning and crafty of the
            Thundercats, it was Wilykit and Wilykat's duty to try and stop
            Lion-O. The Thunderkittens set many traps for Lion-O within the&#32;

            , but Lion-O was able to avoid them all, while also having to battle
            the attacking Mutants. In the end, the Thunderkittens were caught in
            one of their own traps which backfired, and Lion-O rescued them with
            the help of the native creatures before they all ran to the exit.
            The Thunderkittens tried to beat Lion-O to the exit, but he had tied
            their ankles down, and he was able to beat them out, making it
            through the trial of cunning.
