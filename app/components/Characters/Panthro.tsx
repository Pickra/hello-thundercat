            with the other ThunderCat Nobles aboard their flagship.
            Panthro piloted the ship, watching as Thundera exploded before their
            eyes. Along with the other ThunderCats, Panthro was given new
            clothing and weapons (specifically a set of&nbsp;fighting sticks
            known as nunchucks)&nbsp;by&nbsp;

            attacked and boarded the ship, Panthro left with the other
            ThunderCats to fight them back, crushing a Mutant weapon with his
            bare hands and demonstrating his considerable strength. Panthro
            objected to Jaga's wish to not enter suspension with the others and
            pilot the ship himself, but Panthro realised that the auto pilot
            could not be trusted. Panthro entered a suspension capsule and made
            sure&#32;

            Mumm-Ra used him to create a clone of Panthro, which was then
            brought to life by the spirit of&#32;

            went out to wreak havoc, Panthro found himself dropped into a
            radiation pit by Mumm-Ra. Panthro eventually managed to escape the
            pit and he faced his clone in battle. Having bested it, Lion-O then
            used the Sword of Omens to destroy the cloned Panthro.
