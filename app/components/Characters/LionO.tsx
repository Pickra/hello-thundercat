            At the beginning of the series, Lion-O is a boy of mere twelve years old.

            until he became an adult of age twenty-four; this was due to the
            suspension capsule diminishing but not altogether preventing aging
            ("<a

            >Jaga</a> had mentioned that some aging does take place while in the
            Suspension Capsules in which he and the other ThunderCats were
            placed when their flagship was damaged.

            The now grown-up Lion-O assumed that this was the reason for his aging
            to adulthood, though he did not express any confusion regarding why
            WilyKat and WilyKit had not also aged as he had, which seems to indicate
            that he simply accepted it as a quirk of the capsules.
            Although cunning and skillful, he is truly a child in a man's body,
            and throughout the series, must learn what it takes to become a true
            leader and gain true maturity.
