            A staunch, level-headed warrior based on the tiger,
            Tygra is the one Lion-O often turns to as second-in-command and for
            counsel. He is responsible for the design of all of the ThunderCat
            structures on Third Earth — the&#32;

            He is also gifted with "mind-power" — the ability to create
            life-like illusions in other people’s minds; he used this for
            Lion-O’s Annointment Trial, but it puts a great strain on him.
